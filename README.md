.ino files sourced here are intended for use with ARM based Arduino boards (Arduino DUE)

## Instructions
Download Arduino IDE.

Install 'Adafruit Neomatrix' + dependencies from extensions tab.

Connect Arduino DUE to computer via 'programming' usb port - this is the one closest to the black DC connector.

Upload downloaded code to the arduino by pressing the upload button in top let corner (V1.1 is optimal and includes 'easy mode' option for younger children).
